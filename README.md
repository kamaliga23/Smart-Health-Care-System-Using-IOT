A Smart Healthcare System using IoT leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technology to enhance patient monitoring, diagnostics, and treatment. It integrates smart sensors, wearable devices, and cloud-based analytics to collect real-time health data such as heart rate, temperature, oxygen levels, and ECG. This data is transmitted to healthcare providers for remote monitoring, early disease detection, and emergency alerts. IoT-enabled healthcare systems improve efficiency, reduce hospital visits, and enable telemedicine services, making healthcare more accessible, cost-effective, and responsive.
